This is only for linux. Windows Subsystem for Linux might work for this but I really don't know
<h1>Required libraries</h1>
Run

`sudo apt-get install caca-utils` and
`sudo apt install mplayer` if you don't have them.
# In case if it just shows the commands when you open the .sh file
Give the .sh file permissions via `chmod +x "path/to/the/cantalope.sh"`

this can have customizable things like you can change the video whatever you want (as long it has the file name as "cantalope" and the file type is mpg unless you edit the sh file for mp4)
